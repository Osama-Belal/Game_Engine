# Game Engine
In this project, we investigate the difference between the features of object oriented and functional paradigms 
by implementing a generic game engine for drawing game boards. 
The engine supports drawing six games: Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect-4, Checkers, Chess, Sudoku and 8-Queens, however, 
it is extensible to draw any other board game (e.g., Go Game).

## The engine have only two responsibilities: 
- Drawing the board and pieces
- Enforce the rules of moving pieces

# Feel Free to try it out
